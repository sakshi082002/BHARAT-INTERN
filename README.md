1.I developed an innovative SMS classifier utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques to enhance message organization for seamless communication. The project began with data loading, where a ZIP file containing the SMS dataset was downloaded, extracted, and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Text preprocessing followed, including converting text to lowercase, removing non-word characters, extra whitespaces, and stopwords using NLTK. Data visualization was employed to plot a pie chart illustrating the distribution of spam and non-spam messages. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. For feature extraction, TF-IDF vectorization was applied, considering both unigrams and bigrams. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was selected, with grid search used to optimize hyperparameters (alpha) through cross-validation. The best classifier was trained on the training set, and its performance was evaluated on the test set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The results, including the best hyperparameters, accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, were printed to the console.

2.I developed an image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately distinguish between cats and dogs. The process began with dataset preparation, where a collection of images was organized into training and testing sets. I constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Sequential API, featuring convolutional layers with max-pooling for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. The model was trained over 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Performance evaluation on the testing dataset revealed impressive accuracy. Additionally, I visualized the training history to analyze the model's accuracy and loss over epochs. Finally, the modelâ€™s ability to classify cats and dogs was demonstrated through predictions on sample images from the test set.
